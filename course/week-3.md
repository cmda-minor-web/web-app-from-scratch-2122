# Week 3: ‘Design & refactor’ 🛠

Minor Web Development - Web App From Scratch

## Intention

### Goal this week: ‘Design & refactor’ 🛠

Iterate on the user story. Add routes and states. refactor code into modules.

### Next week: ‘Wrapping up’ 🎁

Manipulate data and templating. Split code into modules. Reflect on what you made. [Check it out](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/web-app-from-scratch-2122/blob/main/course/week-4.md)

## Sub tasks

1. Handle routes to manage state  
2. Design the code logic of your application  
3. Refactor code into modules 


### 1. Handle routes to manage state 

On a single page web app you will have to create the URLs (or routes) to the different "pages" in JavaScript. For example if you want to be able to navigate to a detail page. You can do this by using the hash (#) in the url, in combination with the hashchange event. Making a router yourself is quite complicated, so this is a good opportunity to use a micro library. Routie.js is a simple hash router that you can use.

### 2. Design the code logic of your application 
#### Create actor diagram - Who

Visualize where your code lives in a comprehensible way. Ensure that all objects, properties, methods and any variables and functions are included. Look at the included documentation see how you do this. Put the actor diagram in your README.md of the forked repo.

Perform the step-by-step of the documentation below.

#### Create interaction diagram - What

How does the interaction between user and app work? For example, when will data be loaded? Which use cases are possible? We will do the assessment based on this diagram and your actor diagram. Put the interaction diagram in your README.md of the forked repo.

Perform the step-by-step of the documentation below

### 3. Refactor code into modules 

Now that you have gained a better understanding, using the diagrams, it may be time to refactor the structure of your app. In other words, how are you going to code or refactor the various actors and the dependencies between them in your app? Split up your coe into modules.
