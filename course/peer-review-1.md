# Peer review exercise

## Goal
- Learn how to give technical feedback
- Get feedback on your work
- Help a buddy!

## Preparation
- Find your buddy
- Push the latest changes to your readme, code, and wiki
- [Read the rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTC69BUOGNQj_bLQE9LiprKGYChzb4LOoROoUiLUP8DReOcFLqS5k90Wu1LK9L5r1IVq7BDA1qISp5u/pubhtml). Is everything clear?

## Internal Buddy Review (vertical)
Review your buddy! If you are less experienced than your buddy, try to see if you can make sense of their work. Make notes of stuff that could be useful to you and try to learn from their work.
If you're more experienced try to review your buddy in a way that's helpful to them.

Write your feedback in issues on their repo (separate issue for each thing). 
- [How issues fit into the Github workflow](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
- [How to write useful Github issues](https://upthemes.com/blog/2014/02/writing-useful-github-issues/)
Positive feedback is also welcome and can be put into an issue

### Repository
- Scan your buddy's repository
    + Is there a repo description at the top?
    + Is the repo open to issues?
    + Does it include a gitignore
    + Is the concept described well in the readme?
    + Is the API described in the readme?

### Code
- Read the code
    + Try to understand the code flow
    + Check the code against our course's [best practices](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/best-practices/blob/master/web-app-from-scratch.md)
    + Check the code for consistency, is code being written the same way in different places?
    + Does the code follow naming conventions? Do variable and function names make sense to you?

## External Review (horizontal)
Wait until the whole class has finished the internal review.
Find a buddy who is close to your experience level. Review the repo and code again.

## Closure
- Review the issues that were created for your own repo. Ask your reviewer about them if you don't understand.
- Respond to the issues with a message describing whih action you take. For instance: valid point, will fix. Or: I won't fix this because of ...
- Close issues when they are solved.
