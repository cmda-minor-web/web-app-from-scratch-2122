## 1. Internal Buddy Review (vertical)

Review your buddy! If you are less experienced than your buddy, try to see if you can make sense of their work. Make notes of stuff that could be useful to you and try to learn from their work.
If you're more experienced try to review your buddy in a way that's helpful to them.

Write your feedback in issues on their repo (separate issue for each thing). 
- [How issues fit into the Github workflow](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
- [How to write useful Github issues](https://upthemes.com/blog/2014/02/writing-useful-github-issues/)
Positive feedback is also welcome and can be put into an issue

### Repository

- Scan your buddy's repository
    + Is there a repo description at the top?
    + Is there a link to the live web app provided with GitHub Pages?
    + Is the repo open to issues?
    + Does it include a gitignore
    + Is the concept described well in the readme?
    + Is the API described in the readme?

### Code

- Read the code
    + Try to understand the code flow
    + Check the code against our course's [best practices](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/best-practices/blob/master/web-app-from-scratch.md)
    + Check the code for consistency, is code being written the same way in different places?
    + Does the code follow naming conventions? Do variable and function names make sense to you?
    + Feel free to give feedback on HTML and CSS aswell!
